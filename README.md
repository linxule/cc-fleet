Provider workers are **real Claude Code teammates** — driven exactly like native ones — with
the LLM backend swapped to any provider that exposes an Anthropic-compatible API. Your main
session's own auth (OAuth subscription or API key) is untouched; provider workers bill the
provider API key via `apiKeyHelper`, and the key never enters env, argv, or shell history.

`cc-fleet` is a small Go CLI plus one Claude Code skill. The CLI manages per-provider
profiles, dispatches API keys via `apiKeyHelper`, and spawns teammate sessions in tmux
panes. The skill teaches Claude Code *when* to delegate work to those teammates.

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** (the `claude` CLI) on your PATH.
- **tmux** — provider teammates run in tmux panes.
- **macOS or Linux**, amd64 or arm64 — the tested platforms. Windows can in theory run
  the one-shot **subagent** mode, but it is untested.
- **Teammate** mode needs Claude Code's agent-teams enabled. Turn it on in your global
  `~/.claude/settings.json` and restart Claude Code (cc-fleet also nudges you on first run):
  ```json
  { "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1" } }
  ```
  The one-shot **subagent** mode and the interactive **`cc-fleet run`** work without it.

## Quick Install

**One-line (recommended)**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethanhq/cc-fleet/main/install.sh | sh
```
Downloads the prebuilt binary, installs `cc-fleet` + the `ccf` alias, and adds the
skill via the Claude Code plugin. Flags (after `| sh -s --`): `--skill plugin|global|none`,
`--scope user|project|local`, `--prefix DIR`, `--version vX.Y.Z`.

**npm**
```bash
npm install -g @ethanhq/cc-fleet      # or run once: npx @ethanhq/cc-fleet
```
*Binary only — also install the skill (see [The skill](#the-skill)) so Claude Code can use it.*

**go install**
```bash
go install github.com/ethanhq/cc-fleet/cmd/cc-fleet@latest
ln -sf "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/cc-fleet" "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/ccf"   # optional ccf alias
```
*Binary only — also install the skill (see [The skill](#the-skill)) so Claude Code can use it.*

**Prebuilt tarball** — download from [Releases](https://github.com/ethanhq/cc-fleet/releases):
```bash
tar -xzf cc-fleet-*.tar.gz && cd cc-fleet-*/ && ./install.sh
```

**From source**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethanhq/cc-fleet.git && cd cc-fleet && make install
```

> [!NOTE]
> cc-fleet is a **binary + a skill**. The one-line installer and tarball set up both;
> **npm, go install, and source install the binary only** — add the skill via the
> [plugin](#the-skill) so Claude Code knows when to delegate to it.

## Getting Started

Run `cc-fleet` (or the `ccf` alias) with no arguments to open the interactive TUI:

```bash
cc-fleet
```

In the TUI you register a provider — give it a name, its Anthropic-compatible base URL, a
models endpoint, a default model, and paste the API key. The key is written `0600` under
`~/.config/cc-fleet/secrets/` and is **never** passed via argv or shell history.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/tui-add-provider.png" alt="cc-fleet TUI — add provider form" width="760" /></p>

The config tree is created automatically on first save, so there is no separate init step.
The TUI also lists your providers, lets you edit them, and manage multiple keys per provider.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/tui-providers.png" alt="cc-fleet TUI — provider list" width="760" /></p>

Press `tab` to switch to the **Agents Board** — it shows every live teammate grouped by
session → team, with its provider, model, pane, PID, health, and hidden state, plus a list of
subagent jobs. From here you can hide (`h`) / show (`s`) a teammate pane or refresh (`r`).

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/tui-agent-status.png" alt="cc-fleet TUI — Agents Board" width="760" /></p>

Once at least one provider is registered, just talk to Claude Code in plain language. The
skill reads your request and picks how to run the work — there are two execution modes.

### Teammate mode — a long-lived provider worker on your team

> *"Spawn a deepseek teammate to refactor the parser package, then report back."*

Runs the provider as a **real Claude Code agent-team teammate**:

- Claude calls native `TeamCreate`; cc-fleet launches the provider's own `claude` process in a tmux pane.
- Claude drives it with native `SendMessage` — you assign tasks, it works and reports back.
- The teammate **stays alive across turns**, so you keep handing it follow-ups. Run several in parallel.
- Your main session keeps its own auth — only the teammate pane bills the provider key (via `apiKeyHelper`).

> [!NOTE]
> Teammate mode needs Claude Code's agent-teams enabled — see [Requirements](#requirements).

Start inside a tmux session so the teammates split into panes alongside your lead:

```bash
tmux new-session -s cc-fleet
```

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/teammate-panes.png" alt="cc-fleet teammates — lead on the left, deepseek and glm teammate panes on the right" width="760" /></p>

> Lead session on the left; a `deepseek` and a `glm` teammate in their own panes on the right —
> each a real `claude` process, driven by `SendMessage` exactly like a native teammate.

> [!TIP]
> **Not in tmux?** cc-fleet runs the teammate in a detached `cc-fleet-swarm-<team>` server
> instead — same `TeamCreate` / `SendMessage` flow, the pane just isn't on screen. Attach with
> `tmux -L cc-fleet-swarm-<team> attach` to watch it.

### Subagent mode — a one-shot headless call

> *"Use deepseek to summarize this 2,000-line log file."*

`cc-fleet subagent [provider]` runs the provider model headless and returns the result
synchronously — **no pane, no team, no agent-teams**. Ideal for one-off analysis and batch
fan-out of independent tasks.

| Flag | Use |
|------|-----|
| `--background` | run detached; poll with `cc-fleet subagent-status` |
| `--resume <id>` | continue a previous subagent (multi-turn) |
| `--max-budget-usd` / `--max-turns` | bound cost and runtime |

> [!NOTE]
> You never pick the mode by hand — Claude decides teammate vs subagent from the request,
> spawns the provider worker, and coordinates it for you.

### Run a provider in your own session

> *Not delegation — this one is all you.*

```bash
cc-fleet run deepseek                          # an interactive claude, on DeepSeek
cc-fleet run deepseek --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

`cc-fleet run [provider]` drops you straight into an interactive Claude Code session with the LLM
backend swapped to the provider — the same `claude` you know, just on DeepSeek / GLM / Qwen / … and
billing the provider key. Reach for a cheaper or different-jurisdiction model for your own
day-to-day coding, not only for delegated work. `--model` overrides the default; `--permission-mode`
/ `--dangerously-skip-permissions` set the permission posture. **No tmux, no agent-teams** — just a
terminal.

### ChatGPT subscription as a provider (codex)

> *Have a Codex / ChatGPT subscription? Drive gpt-5.x with it too.*

```bash
cc-fleet codex add && cc-fleet codex login
```

One `codex add` plus a device-code login turns the subscription into a regular provider —
teammate, subagent, workflow leaf, or `cc-fleet run`, all answering through gpt-5.x. A local
conversion daemon translates Claude's Anthropic calls to the OpenAI Responses API; the OAuth
token stays inside the daemon (never in env, argv, or a profile), and cc-fleet keeps its own
login so the codex CLI's auth is untouched. **Unofficial** — `codex login` asks for explicit
confirmation; details in [the CLI guide](docs/cli.md#codex--reuse-a-chatgpt-subscription-as-a-provider).

### More example prompts

- *"Spawn a glm teammate and a deepseek teammate; have each summarize its model's strengths, then compare the two."*
- *"Use deepseek to review the diff in `internal/spawn` and list any bugs you find."*
- *"Fan out kimi, qwen, and glm subagents over these three files in parallel and collect the results."*
- *"Spin up a deepseek teammate to port the test suite to table-driven form, then report back."*

## CLI & advanced usage

Claude drives the CLI for you, but every command also works by hand — multi-key rotation,
`hide`/`show`, background/resumable subagents, secret backends, teardown order, and more.
See **[CLI reference & advanced usage](docs/cli.md)**, or run `cc-fleet <cmd> --help`.

## The skill

The binary is just the CLI. To teach Claude Code *when* to delegate, install the skill
via the plugin (the one-line installer does this by default):
```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ethanhq/cc-fleet
claude plugin install cc-fleet@ethanhq
```
