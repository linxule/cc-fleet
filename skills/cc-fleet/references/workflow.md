# Workflow runtime — JavaScript orchestration over vendor subagents

A **workflow** is a JavaScript script that fans out vendor `cc-fleet subagent` leaves and
runs in a **cc-fleet process, OFF the main session's context**. You write the script;
`cc-fleet workflow run` executes it. The orchestration plan lives in script variables
(CPU, ~0 of your tokens) — you are invoked only when *authoring* the script, not on
every scheduling decision. The API mirrors the native Claude Code Workflow tool — write
the script exactly as you would a native workflow; the only addition is that `agent()`
takes a required `vendor` option.

## When to use it
- **Multi-phase or dynamic** orchestration over many vendor subagents: fan-out + barrier,
  per-item pipeline, loop-until-dry, branch-on-result, with a board run-tree.
- A single flat batch of independent one-shots is **not** a workflow — that's a lane-2
  `cc-fleet subagent` batch (`references/subagent.md`). Don't write a script for it.

## The script API (mirrors the native Workflow tool)
- `const meta = {name, description, whenToUse?, model?, phases?: [{title, detail?}]}` — a
  top-level **pure literal** (no calls/vars/spreads; the native `export const meta` form
  is also accepted). `name` + `description` are **required**; `model` is the default for
  agents that omit it. Read statically before the run → the board shows the named,
  phase-skeletoned run immediately.
- `agent(prompt, opts) → Promise<string|object>` — runs ONE vendor subagent leaf.
  `opts.vendor` is **required**; the rest are optional: `model`, `schema`, `label`,
  `phase`, `timeout` (seconds), `max_budget_usd`, `max_turns`, `isolation: "worktree"`,
  `profile` ("slim" default / "slim-ro" / "full"), `tools`, `skills`, `mcp`. An unknown
  option key throws (typos fail loudly). On a leaf failure the promise **rejects** — an
  un-caught top-level `await agent()` aborts the run; inside `parallel`/`pipeline` a
  failed element degrades to `null`.
  - **`schema`** (a plain object) goes to the claude child via `--json-schema`: claude
    injects a forced `StructuredOutput` tool and enforces that it is CALLED (the native
    mechanism — no JSON instruction is added to the prompt); the promise resolves with the
    parsed structured payload. Client-side validation stays as a backstop — a recursive
    JSON-Schema subset: `type` (object/array/string/number/integer/boolean/null; `integer`
    accepts `5.0`), `required`, nested `properties`, array `items`, scalar `enum`, string
    `pattern` (RE2 best-effort — the wire enforces the authoritative ECMA regex) / `format`
    (email/uri/uuid/date/date-time), `additionalProperties`, `allOf`/`anyOf`/`oneOf`, and
    intra-document `$ref` (`#/…` pointers, e.g. `#/$defs/Addr`; an external URI is
    unsupported and fails). A validation failure — or a result envelope without a
    structured payload — FAILS the leaf; there is no automatic retry. The forced
    `StructuredOutput` call costs turns: give a schema'd leaf `max_turns` ≥ 3 headroom (a
    budget of 1 starves it). `schema` needs claude ≥ 2.1.88 (the slim-profile floor); an
    older claude fails the leaf with a classified usage error.
  - **`isolation: "worktree"`** runs the leaf with cwd = a fresh git worktree (torn down
    after), so parallel file-editing leaves don't collide (requires a git repo).
  - **`profile`**: `"slim"` (the default: generic-subagent mirror; keeps CLAUDE.md) or
    `"slim-ro"` (read-only Explore mirror; no CLAUDE.md) swaps the full session prompt for
    the native subagent shape — a far smaller first request per leaf; rule of thumb:
    writes files → `slim`, read-only research → `slim-ro`; `"full"` restores the full
    session prompt — use it ONLY to compare behavior against a full session or to diagnose
    a suspected slim regression. Default tool sets — slim: Bash, Edit, Glob, Grep, Read,
    Skill, Write; slim-ro: Bash, Glob, Grep, Read, Skill. Any tool beyond the whitelist
    (e.g. WebSearch / WebFetch) must be passed explicitly via `tools`, and `tools`
    REPLACES the whole set, never appends — `tools: ["WebSearch"]` gives the leaf ONLY
    WebSearch. `tools`, `skills` (default `true`) and `mcp` refine a slim leaf and are
    rejected with `profile: "full"`; `mcp` defaults per profile — slim inherits the host
    MCP config (native parity), slim-ro runs `--strict-mcp-config` — and an explicit `mcp`
    (either value) overrides. The run journal folds the effective profile + tools, so a
    `--resume` re-runs a leaf whose shape changed; on a claude below 2.1.88 the leaf fails
    open to `full` (notice logged before the journal lookup).
- **Background = an unawaited promise.** There is no `run_in_background`/`wait()`: start a
  leaf with `const p = agent(...)`, keep working, `await p` later (`Promise.all` for a
  batch). Every leaf — awaited or not — is pool-bounded, journaled at completion, and the
  run only finalizes after all of them settle. A leaf that **rejects with nobody ever
  handling it fails the run** (a silently dropped failure is still a failure); fire-and-
  forget tolerance is an explicit `p.catch(() => null)`.
- `parallel(thunks) → Promise<array>` — run each 0-arg thunk concurrently; **BARRIER**
  (settles once all finish), `null` where an element failed:
  `await parallel([() => agent("a", {vendor: "glm"}), () => agent("b", {vendor: "glm"})])`.
  Concurrent execs stay ~pool size even for a huge list (excess queues).
- `pipeline(items, ...stages) → Promise<array>` — push each item through all stages
  independently with **NO inter-stage barrier** (item A can be in stage 3 while B is in
  stage 1). Each stage is `(prev, item, index) => …` (sync or async; its return value is
  awaited). A failing stage drops that item to `null` and skips its remaining stages.
  **DEFAULT to `pipeline` over `parallel`** — only use `parallel` when a stage genuinely
  needs ALL prior results together.
- `workflow(path, args?) → Promise` — run another `.js` inline on the same engine (shared
  pool/journal/budget), **one level deep** only; resolves with the child's top-level
  `return` value.
- `budget` — two parallel cap surfaces. **USD:** `budget.total` (the `--budget-usd` cap in
  USD, or `null`), `budget.spent()`, `budget.remaining()` (`Infinity` when uncapped) — USD
  floats (an Anthropic list-price estimate). **Tokens:** `budget.tokens_total` (the
  `--budget-tokens` cap, or `null`), `budget.tokens_spent()`, `budget.tokens_remaining()`
  — ints (input+output, cache-read excluded). `agent()` throws once **either** cap is
  reached; a `while (budget.remaining() > N)` loop scales depth to the cap. (Native's
  `budget.total` is a token target; here it is **USD** — `--budget-usd` is the
  cross-vendor cap since vendors price tokens differently — and tokens are the separate
  `tokens_*` surface.)
- `phase(title, detail?)` — name the current phase (tags subsequent agents lacking an
  explicit `phase`; the detail shows on the board row). `log(msg)` — a narrator line
  (board live log + stderr).
- `args` — the parsed `--args-json '<json>'` value (or the `workflow(child, args)` value);
  `undefined` when none was given.

## What a workflow script can NOT use (determinism — the journal depends on it)
- `Date` / `Math.random()` **throw**; `eval` / `Function` / dynamic code are removed;
  there is **no** `setTimeout` / `console` / `require` / `fs` / ESM `import` — use
  `log()`, not `console.log`, and pass timestamps or randomness in via `args`.
- Plain script statements only (the body runs inside an async wrapper, so top-level
  `await` and `return` work); async generators (`async function*`) are not supported.

## Running it
```bash
RUN=$(cc-fleet workflow run audit.js)        # detached; prints ONLY the bare run id
cc-fleet workflow status "$RUN" --json       # manifest + every tagged leaf (run→phase→agent)
cc-fleet workflow list --json                # all runs, newest first
cc-fleet workflow stop "$RUN"                # reap a running run (engine + in-flight leaves)
# or watch the board's Dynamic Workflows view: live log, token/cost columns, prompt/answer drill-in,
# x = stop, r = restart (= run --resume). --foreground runs inline (debug).
# --max-concurrency N overrides the default pool (min(16, cores-2));
# --budget-usd N caps total spend; --no-persist-io disables the prompt/answer drill-in.
```
The run is detached so it outlives this call and your session stays responsive; poll
`workflow status` or watch the board.

To surface a detached run INSIDE this session (the run is otherwise invisible here):
```bash
cc-fleet workflow watch "$RUN"               # stream its live events as text until it finishes
cc-fleet watch                               # stream the whole fleet (teammates + jobs + runs)
```
Run either in a backgrounded shell to surface it in the `/tasks` panel, or delegate the
`cc-fleet:workflow-watch` agent (a run id) / `cc-fleet:fleet-watch` agent (the fleet) to surface
it in the agent panel. Both are read-only and print only canonical status — never a vendor reply.

## Resume (content-hash journal)
Each run records a content-hash **journal** of its completed leaves. Re-run the same
script under an existing run id to replay:
```bash
cc-fleet workflow run audit.js --resume "$RUN"   # journaled leaves return cached (no vendor exec); only un-run leaves run
```
A leaf is keyed by its determinant (vendor + model + prompt + schema + slim shape), so an
unchanged re-run is ~100% cache hits, a leaf whose prompt you edited (and anything
downstream of its output) re-runs, and a run that was killed resumes by replaying what
finished before the kill. The determinism lockdown makes this exact: with no clock/PRNG,
the same script+args produce the same keys. A **failed** leaf is never journaled, so
resume re-runs it.

## Non-goals (state plainly, don't oversell)
- **No pause.** A running `claude -p` can't be cleanly suspended; use `workflow stop`
  (reaps the run) + `run --resume` (cheap restart via the journal) instead.
- **Client-side `schema` validation is a JSON-Schema subset** — the list above, not the
  full spec (an external `$ref` URI is unsupported and fails; an unknown `format` is an
  annotation, not enforced). claude enforces that `StructuredOutput` is called; this
  backstop checks what it was filled with, and a failure is terminal (no retry).
- Key-safety is unchanged: the vendor key flows only via `apiKeyHelper`; prompts go to the
  leaf via stdin, never argv; the journal/events/board carry no key.

## Worked example — research sweep (fan-out → pipeline → loop)
```js
const meta = {
    name: "api audit",
    description: "map endpoints, draft checks, then probe for gaps",
    phases: [{title: "map"}, {title: "build"}, {title: "probe"}],
};

phase("map");
const maps = (await parallel(
    args.map((m) => () => agent("List exported endpoints in module " + m,
                                {vendor: "deepseek", label: "map:" + m}))
)).filter(Boolean);  // e.g. --args-json '["auth","billing","users"]'

phase("build");
// pipeline (no barrier): each map flows straight into its own checklist draft
const checklists = await pipeline(
    maps,
    (prev, item, i) => agent("Draft an audit checklist for these endpoints:\n" + prev,
                             {vendor: "glm", label: "build:" + i}),
);

phase("probe");
const gaps = [];
while (gaps.length < 10) {           // loop-until-dry (the runtime hard-caps 1000 leaves/run)
    const g = await agent("Given these checklists, name ONE uncovered risk, or reply NONE:\n"
                          + checklists.join("\n"), {vendor: "kimi"});
    if (g.trim() === "NONE") break;
    gaps.push(g);
}

log(`done: ${maps.length} maps, ${checklists.length} checklists, ${gaps.length} gaps`);
return { maps, checklists, gaps };
```
One run, three phases, a barriered fan-out, a no-barrier pipeline, and a bounded
loop-until-dry — all sequenced by the script in a cc-fleet process, off your context.

## Anti-patterns
- A script for a single flat independent batch → use lane-2 `cc-fleet subagent`.
- `console.log` / `Date.now()` / `setTimeout` — unavailable (determinism); use `log()`
  and pass timestamps via `args`.
- Trusting `schema` as deep validation, or treating a plain `agent()` result as JSON
  without `schema`.
- Unbounded ambition: the runtime hard-caps 1000 `agent()` calls/run, pools concurrency
  at `min(16, cores-2)`, and caps a single `parallel`/`pipeline` list at 100,000 elements.
