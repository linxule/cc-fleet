// files) and ALWAYS runs; js settles the leaf's promise — executing the script's
// awaiting continuations before it returns — and is SKIPPED once the run is aborted:
// the script is already dead and the VM may be interrupted, and a dropped settlement
// loses nothing durable because the leaf's job file carries its own terminal status.
