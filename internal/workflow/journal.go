// journal is a run's append-only content-hash cache of completed leaf results — the
// engine of cross-invocation resume. On `workflow run --resume <id>` (or any re-run
// reusing the id) a leaf whose content key is journaled returns its cached result
// WITHOUT a vendor exec; only un-journaled leaves (new, edited, or failed-last-time)
// run. Because Starlark bans the clock/PRNG, the same script+args produce the same
// keys, so an unchanged re-run is ~100% cache hits and a killed run resumes by
// replaying the leaves that finished before the kill.
//
// Every access is under the engine GIL — lookup before a leaf's exec, append after
// runBlocking re-locks — so `seen` needs no separate lock and appends never interleave.
// All methods are nil-receiver-safe: an engine constructed without a journal (the leaf
// unit tests) simply never caches.
//
// `seen` is the PRIOR-RUN snapshot, loaded once at engine start and NOT mutated by
// append. So replay serves only results journaled by an EARLIER invocation; agent() calls
// within the SAME run never memoize against each other.
//
// Each key maps to an ORDERED QUEUE of results (in journaled = original execution order),
// and a lookup CONSUMES one entry. This is what makes duplicate-key leaves correct: a
// script that calls agent() with the same vendor/model/prompt/schema N times (e.g. a
// loop-until-dry probing the same prompt) produces N entries under one key. A run killed
// after K of N completed journals K entries, so on resume the first K calls each pop one
// cached result and calls K+1..N find the queue empty and RE-RUN — only the unrun work
// runs. An unchanged full re-run pops all N (100% hits). A single-key map would instead
// serve every one of the N calls the one surviving result and skip the unrun tail.

// journalEntry is one JSONL line: a successfully-completed leaf's content key and its
// raw answer string. Failed/partial leaves are never written, so resume re-runs them.
// The raw answer string is stored uniformly (schema leaves re-decode+re-validate it on
// replay — deterministic, no vendor exec). The vendor key never enters a result, so the

// journalKey is the content hash of a leaf's result determinant: vendor, model, the
// BASE prompt, the schema JSON, and the isolation mode (a worktree leaf can produce a
// different result than an in-place one). It EXCLUDES display-only fields (label/phase) and
// the caps (timeout/max_budget_usd/max_turns — those only ever yield a failure, which
// is never journaled). model is the EFFECTIVE model: the explicit model= if given, else
// the meta.model fallback (applied in agent() BEFORE this key is computed), else empty —
// in which case the vendor resolves its own default_model at runtime (the caveat below).
// It is keyed as the script determines it, not the vendor-default it later resolves to.
//
// Caveat: when BOTH model= and meta.model are omitted the key holds
// the empty string, so a vendor-config change between a run and its resume — editing a
// vendor's default_model or base_url — is NOT captured, and an omitted-model leaf could
// serve a result produced under the old config.
// In practice a resume reuses the run id moments later under stable config; after a
// deliberate vendor-config change, start a fresh run (or the "v1" scheme prefix can be
// bumped). schemaJSON is the deterministic json.encode of the schema (go.starlark.net
// canonicalizes it → stable).
//
// Each field is LENGTH-PREFIXED (8-byte big-endian) rather than separated by a sentinel
// byte: a prompt is an arbitrary Starlark string that may itself contain any byte, so a
// sentinel-only framing (vendor\x00model\x00prompt…) could collide across field
// boundaries; length-prefixing makes the preimage unambiguous for any content.
